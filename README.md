# Internal friction

## Introduction

When stress is applied on a material, it undergoes mostly either elastic or plastic deformation. Elastic deformations are reversible with no energy loss, while plastic deformations are irreversible with energy loss. Internal friction, however, describes a phenomenon with mixed features: it undergoes a reversible deformation, even though some energy is lost. For bcc materials, the origin is attributed to the geometric anisotropy of the sub-lattices: uniaxial deformations favors or hinders occupation of a certain sub-lattice. While this phenomenon has been intensively studied for bcc materials, fcc materials attracted far less attention, due to the absence of this geometric anisotropy. Yet the same phenomenon has been observed for fcc materials as well, albeit around an order of magnitude less than in bcc materials. The anisotropy is considered to be created in defect pairs, but its origin on the microscopic level is still largely unknown.
